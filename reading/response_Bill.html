Reading this whole essay about computer, low and high load, Apple Lisa and Mac, Microsoft widows and many other things were interesting but not easy to understand. The first few pages of this book talked about the time when it was not usual for people to have their own computer because it was extremely expensive for individual to get it. Since it is too common for people having desktops at home, it was refreshing to know the history of computer and the outdated design. Move on to the Bill Atkinson and his Polaroid photographs; it was well organized with simple memo that explains what the image is about. It was fun to see different graphics, texts and images that happen in Apple Lisa. I enjoyed reading the part that Bill stressed out the importance of the problem against the pressure of cost and technology limitations. Along to the Bill, Paul Bradley and Bill Verplank were mentioned. The mouse development was also interesting because the mouse that I used 10 years ago is definitely different from one that I use today. It was really difficult to focus on to the text because of many unfamiliar computer terms but liked to know the history of computer and its components.
