	<p><a href="eu4.html">Our</a> friend wolf, in the meantime had rushed as fast as he could to grannie’s cottage which he found without any difficulty at all. He knocked on the door, and heard grannie’s weak voice call out: “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“it is I, Little Red Cap, I’ve brought you some meat and wine from my mother. Please open the door for me, grannie”, replied Wolf, making his voice sound as high pitched as he could to deceive the poor grandmother. “Just push up the latch, called grannie, I’m so weak I just can’t get out of my bed!”</p>

<p>So the wolf lifted the latch, threw open the door, and rushed to the bedroom, where he jumped on the bed, and without any further ado, gobbled up the poor grandmother. He then put her cap on his head, and got into her bed, covering himself as much as he could with the bedsheets. There he waited.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait all that long before Little Red Cap appeared outside the cottage. She had collected a nice little bunch of wild flowers and was looking forward to see her grannie’s eyes light up. She was a little surprised to see the front door wide open, she thought that perhaps grandmother had felt a bit better and had been up and about. She stepped into the room, and she thought there was a slightly odd smell about, but she shook off this feeling and called out to her grannie: “Good morning, grannie! <a href="eu7.html">Where are you?</a>"</p>
