	<p><a href="eu7.html">Having</a> now feasted on both the grannie and her little gran daughter, wolf felt particularly satisfied, and he decided he might as well enjoy the home comforts of grannie’s cottage a little longer, and spread himself on the bed. Before long he was fast asleep, emitting very loud snoring noises. Just then, a huntsman passed by the cottage, and he heard the strange noise coming from the bedroom window. His curiosity awakened, he decided to check out the source of this noise, and looked into the window. He immediately recognised the wolf he’d been hunting now for a number of weeks, and cocking his rifle, he stepped into the cottage and made his way to the bedroom. Taking careful aim, he shot the wolf dead.
