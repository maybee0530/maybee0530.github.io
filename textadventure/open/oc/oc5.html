<a href="oc4.html">One day</a> there were two fools in the village of Avera who looked up on the mountain and saw the flock of birds flying around the mountain and they thought that surely there must be a pond of water up on the mountain with fish in it. </p>
<p>So, one morning these two took a fishing pole and some hooks and went up the mountain to look for a place to fish. They soon found this cave and saw the huge eel that was in the pool. They dropped the hook into the pool and shortly thereafter the eel was hooked. He put up a great struggle but he eventually grew tired and could not fight these two <a href="oc6.html">fishermen.</a>'</p>
