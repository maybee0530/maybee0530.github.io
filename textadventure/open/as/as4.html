	The Lady of the Moon
</h1>
<div class="box4">
	<p><a href="as3.html">One</a> of the sorcerers said: </p>
	<p>“That is the man in the moon. The cassia tree grows so luxuriantly that in the course of time it would overshadow all the moon’s radiance. Therefore it has to be cut down once in every thousand years.”</p>
	<p>Then they entered the spreading halls. The silver stories of the castle towered one above the other, and its walls and columns were all formed of liquid crystal. In the walls were cages and ponds, where fishes and birds moved as though alive. The whole moon-world seemed made of glass.</p>
	<p>While they were still looking about them on all sides the Lady of the Moon stepped up to them, clad in a white mantle and a rainbow-colored gown. She smiled and said to the emperor:</p>
	<p>“You are a prince of the mundane world of dust. Great is your fortune, since you have been able to find your way here!”</p>
	<p>And she called for her attendants, who came flying up on white birds, and sang and danced beneath the cassia tree. <a href="as5.html">ax.</a></p>
