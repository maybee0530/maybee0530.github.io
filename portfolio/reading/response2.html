<h1>Reading Response 2</h1>

<p> The meaning of interaction according to dictionary is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effct upon one another. In the reading there are three different views of seeing the "interaction". When it comes to Design-Theoty view, interaction is a way of framing the relationship between people and objects designed for them. Interaction in HCI view is based on an archetypal structure(feedback loop). Interest thing in this section was the "Seven Stages of Action" tht Norman proposed. In this idea there are seven steps of forming an action, which are Forming the goal - Specifying the action - Executing the action - Perceiving the state of the world - Interpreting the state of the world - Evaluating the outcome, and it replies. The third view is System-Theory and it explains the difference of interaction and reaction. So simply clicking a link on a website to transfer is not interaction but a reaction. I agree with Haque's opinion of fixed or dynamic transfer function that decide whether an action is reaction or interaction. For example when I had to do the textadventure project it was really hard to make the website "interactive" but I think according to Haque's opinion my website is just reactioning. The reading also mention about the closed loop and self-regulating system in nature. It is said that self-regulating system has a goal and the goal defines the relationship between system and environment. </p>
