<p> I haven't thought racism as serious problem before I came to America because the socirty that I live was not formed with many races. I sometimes saw hateful comments about asian and black but didn't feel any direct harm. However, when I came to USA I could realize that the racism is such as big issue. Since United States is a country of people from multi-culture, there are diverse races of people living in a same society. People need to respect and understand each other even they have different lifestyle, taste, or way of thinking. It is not only about race but also about respecting individuals. 
On web because of the anonymous people easily say or write vicious comments to other. It sometimes result real hurt to a person who was targetted. Many social medias like twitter, facebook or etc are trying to make system to prevent those discrimination/ineuality problems on their site. But since the administrators who control this system is also a human of certain race and culture, they cannot be objective, as the last paragraph of the article says that "Social media platforms must step away from the idea that they are inherently "fair". The problem of social discrimination on web and solving it will be a big homework. What is important here is that people are aware of this issue and trying to fix it.  </p>
