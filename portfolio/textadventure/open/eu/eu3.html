After she had gone some distance, she heard a rustling in the undergrowth and there appeared before her the wolf. Now this wolf was not a very nice creature, but Little Red Cap, being young and naïve, always assumed everybody she met was just as nice, sweet and honest as she was, so she stopped and greeted the wolf in her usual friendly way.</p>

<p>“Good morning, replied the wolf. You are looking very dainty today. Where would you be going so early in the morning?”</p>

<p>“I’m on my way to see my grandmother, replied Little Red Cap.</p>
