	<p><a href="eu6.html">She</a> heard some grumbling coming from the bedroom, so she walked inside there. It was quite dark in the room, as the curtains were still drawn, so she walked across, and opened the curtains and a window, to let in some fresh air. Then she turned toward the bed, where she saw what she thought was her grandmother lying down, her covers almost covering her whole face. She could see her ears and her eyes, both looked much larger than she remembered.</p>

<p>“Oh grandmother, said Little Red Cap, what great ears you have!”</p>

<p>That’s so I can hear you better, answered wolf.</p>

<p>“And what great eyes you have, grannie!”</p>

<p>“That’s so I can see you properly!” answered wolf, keeping his mouth covered.</p>

<p>“And what great hands you have, grannie!” exclaimed Little Red Cap.</p>

<p>“That’s so I can lift you up!” said wolf.</p>

<p>“But grannie, what great teeth you have!”</p>

<p>“That’s the better to eat you with”, shouted wolf, and he immediately threw aside the bed covers, and jumped out of bed to gobble up poor <a href="eu8.html">Little Red Cap</a></p>
