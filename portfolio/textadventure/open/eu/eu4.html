	<p><a href="eu3.html">That's</a> right, said Little Red Cap. My mother roasted some nice beef yesterday, so that my grandmother might have something nourishing, and I have some wine to lift her spirits. She has not been very well, recently, she added.</p>

<p>And where does this grandmother of yours live? Asked wolf.</p>

<p>Little Red cap gave a detailed description of where grandmother’s house was, down the track a while longer, near some oak trees, and behind some bushes, with a brightly painted front door. A little crooked chimney and a thatched straw roof. “you can’t miss it!” <a href="eu5.html">miss it!</a>"</p>
