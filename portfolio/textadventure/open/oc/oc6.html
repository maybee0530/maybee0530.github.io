<a href="oc5.html">As</a> he was being pulled out of the water he passed by his sister the pandanus tree and he wrapped his tail around her. Because he held tightly to his sister he could not be pulled further. But the two fishermen pulled even harder. Their pulling on the eel was transmitted to the tree and she started to be pulled out by her roots. When the eel saw that his sister's life was threatened he let go and that was the end of him. But his sister lived on in the cave by the empty pool of water.</p>
